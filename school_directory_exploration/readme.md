## 🧰 What I Did

During this project, I:

1. **Loaded and previewed** the NYC High School Directory dataset in Python.  
2. **Cleaned column names** for consistency and ease of analysis.  
3. **Performed filtering and grouping** to summarize key metrics across boroughs and school types.  
4. **Created visualizations** (bar charts, histograms, and summary tables) to highlight enrollment patterns and school characteristics.  
5. **Documented insights** in the notebook, including trends, anomalies, and actionable observations.  

> This task demonstrates proficiency in **data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and storytelling with Python**.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The NYC High School Directory dataset includes information on:

- School names and types
- Enrollment numbers and demographic breakdowns
- Programs and special initiatives offered by each school
- Borough and location information

## 📌 Key Takeaways

1. **School Distribution vs. Enrollment Size:**  
   Boroughs like the Bronx and Manhattan have more schools but serve fewer students than Queens and Staten Island, suggesting that schools in Queens and Staten Island are larger on average.

2. **Access to Advanced Programs Varies:**  
   Access to Advanced Placement, online AP, and language classes is not evenly distributed across boroughs. Some boroughs have significantly more schools offering these programs, reflecting potential disparities in academic opportunities.

3. **Gender Equity in PSAL Sports:**  
   There is no significant gender imbalance in PSAL sports offerings. Boys’, girls’, and combined sports are offered at similar rates, indicating equitable access to athletic programs across schools.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1. Open the **`analysis.ipynb`** notebook in JupyterLab, VS Code, or any compatible environment.  
2. Run the notebook to replicate the analysis and visualizations.  
3. Use the cleaned dataset and insights for **further exploration, reporting, or integration into dashboards**.
